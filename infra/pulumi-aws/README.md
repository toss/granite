# @granite-js/pulumi-aws

A Pulumi package for managing React Native CDN infrastructure on AWS.

## Installation

Follow the official Pulumi installation guide to install the Pulumi CLI:

* [Pulumi Installation Guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/)


## Pulumi Configuration

```bash
pulumi new aws-typescript
```

Then, install the `@granite-js/pulumi-aws` package and dependencies:

```bash
npm install @granite-js/pulumi-aws
# or
yarn add @granite-js/pulumi-aws
# or
pnpm add @granite-js/pulumi-aws
```

## Usage

To use the `ReactNativeBundleCDN` component, import it into your Pulumi program and instantiate it with the required arguments:

```typescript
import * as pulumi from '@pulumi/pulumi';
import * as aws from '@pulumi/aws';
import { ReactNativeBundleCDN } from '@granite-js/pulumi-aws';

const config = new pulumi.Config();

const reactNativeCdn = new ReactNativeBundleCDN('myReactNativeBundleCDN', {
    bucketName: config.require('bucketName'),
    region: config.require('region')
});

// Print to CLi
export const url = cdn.cloudfrontDomain;
```

Ensure your configuration variables (`bucketName` and `region`) are set in the Pulumi configuration:

```bash
pulumi config set bucketName your-bucket-name
pulumi config set region us-west-2
```


## AWS Credentials Setup

Configure your AWS credentials for Pulumi by exporting your AWS credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
export AWS_REGION="your-region"
```

Alternatively, configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

## Deploying with Pulumi

To deploy your infrastructure, run:

```bash
pulumi up
```

Review the changes that Pulumi proposes, then confirm deployment. Pulumi will provision your React Native CDN infrastructure on AWS.

## Cleaning up

To remove the deployed resources, use:

```bash
pulumi destroy
```

Review and confirm the destruction to remove all resources managed by your Pulumi stack.
