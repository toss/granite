# Comparison with Traditional RN

While Granite is built on React Native, it offers key advantages over traditional React Native development:

|                        | Granite                                          | Traditional React Native                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Architecture           | Microservices - built and deployed independently | Monolithic - entire app built as one unit |
| Brownfield integration | Easy                                             | Hard                                      |
| JS Build               | Seconds                                          | Minutes or more                           |
| Bundle Size            | As low as 200KB per service                      | 1-5MB or larger                           |
| Bundler                | ESBuild                                          | Metro                                     |
| OTA Updates            | Built-in                                         | Requires third-party solutions            |
| Native Build           | Fast (uses prebuilt frameworks)                  | Slow (builds from scratch)                |
